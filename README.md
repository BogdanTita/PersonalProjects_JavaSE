# PersonalProjects_JavaSE


A few personal projects meant to deepen my understanding of various concepts like OOP, algorithms and serialization

1. Player Status Class: 
    The goal was to create a "PlayerStatus" class which keeps track of a player who is updated throughout the game. 
    The game design takes into account the player's score, lives, health and weapon type, as well offering a duel option where all of the above criteria is taken into consideration. 
    As a bonus requirement, I implemented a map for a better visualization of the playeropponent relative position. Was quite proud of it at the moment. Kinda trivial now.

2. Guest Registration System: 
    A back-end system which automatically processes a person's registration to an event. 
    It takes into account the available number of seats and determines if the person belongs on the guest list or waiting list, as well as it updates both lists according to different scenarios. 
    Main focus: OOP principles, algorithms, serialization. A reapload of the same project but with binary I/O implementation, as soon as we studied this part of Java.

3. Surprise Sharing System:
    The goal was to manage different sorts of surprises, by creating and sharing them randomly. 
    Main focus: OOP concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Upcasting, Interface usage, Factory pattern.

4. Reverse Polish Notation + Radix Sort Algorithm:
    A different implementation of a calculator as well as a Radix Sort Algorithm.
